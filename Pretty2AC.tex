``Driving north along Highway 33  nicknamed the ``Petroleum Highway''  the group turned off to the east, down a narrow, unmarked and publicly accessible dirt road. A large tanker truck was visible in the distance. It appeared to be dumping water into the ground. Minutes later, the tour approached a gate with a sign reading ``Danger H2S May Be Present.'' Tour members stepped out of the vehicles and were immediately hit with a noxious odor. Several tied bandanas around their mouths and noses to block the fumes. In less than five minutes, many in the group complained of nausea and headaches. The site consisted of a few dozen long narrow ponds, some with standing liquids of different shades of green, brown and black, some dry and empty. The closest pond contained two thick pipes that were discharging steaming black and green fluids to the pond, while vapors visibly rose off the surface of the ponds. A thick black ring of what appeared to be oil rimmed the bank and a shimmering black layer floated on the surface. Pipes connected the first pond receiving the discharge to other, larger ponds stretching out hundreds of yards into the distance.''

\ul{``Frac ponds are another common reason why fracking companies have a bad reputation with environmentalists and the general population. Frac ponds are essentially open-air pools where wastewater is stored and allowed to evaporate into the air over time. This has obvious air contamination concerns, but these ponds are also dangerous for wildlife that confuse the dirty wastewater with fresh water to drink.} Our above-ground storage tanks are an excellent alternative to these frac ponds, and they are much more environmentally friendly.”

``\ul{Fracking enjoys loopholes from a number of our bedrock environmental laws,'' Raichel notes. For example, oil and gas waste is not considered a hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.} This can make it difficult for concerned citizens to push the needle on a federal level, but it’s still important to call your elected representatives and urge them to close these loopholes. ``Although sweeping change might be slow in coming, staying vocal keeps the pressure on elected officials and industry,” Raichel says. ``As we’ve seen before, if there is enough of a groundswell, it will make a difference.”

\paragraph{}
``Waste from oil and gas fracking is exempt from the hazardous waste provisions of the federal Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA), exacerbating the toxic threats posed by fracking wastewater. For other industries, the threats posed by toxic waste have been at least reduced due to the adoption of the RCRA, which provides a national framework for regulating hazardous waste. In other industries, illegal dumping is reduced by cradle-to-grave tracking and criminal penalties. Health-threatening practices such as open waste pits, disposal in ordinary landfills, and road spreading are prohibited.”

``The federal government has largely exempted oil and gas wastes from the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), leaving each state to regulate its own oil and gas waste. This exemption also allows oil and gas waste disposal into class II wells, rather than the more tightly regulated class I injection wells that must meet more stringent construction and siting standards. Without direct federal oversight, California regulators are solely responsible for ensuring oil and gas wastes are handled in a manner that does not threaten water or air quality.''

\subsubsection{What's In The Wastewater}
\paragraph{}

\textit{
\underline{Award-winning journalist Melissa Troutman, Truthout, February 21, 2019}
( Melissa Troutman is an award-winning journalist and filmmaker who joined Earthworks as a research and policy analyst in 2018.

\normalsize
\subparagraph{}
``\textbf{Salt.} Flowback and produced water are highly salty. This is because salts are added to the fracturing fluid and also released from the geologic formation. Produced water is so famous for salinity that the hydrocarbon industry often refers to it simply as “saltwater” or “brine.” In the Marcellus Shale, flowback water has been measured at 32,300 mg per liter of sodium. For comparison, EPA guidelines call for a maximum of 20 mg/L in drinking water.
\subparagraph{}
\textbf{Industrial chemicals.} Flowback and produced water contain chemicals that have been injected into the well to facilitate drilling. For example, in the Marcellus Shale, flowback water contains high concentrations of sodium, magnesium, iron, barium, strontium, manganese, methanol, chloride, sulfate and other substances.
\subparagraph{}
\textbf{Hydrocarbons.} Produced water can contain hydrocarbons -- including the toxic substances benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene – which can be freed during the drilling process.
\subparagraph{}
\textbf{Radioactive materials.}Water returned to the surface during drilling can carry naturally occurring radioactive materials, referred to by the industry as “NORM.” Flowback and produced water from several large U.S. shale formations have been found to contain the radioactive element radium. When produced water is salty and rich in chlorides, radium tends to be present in higher concentrations.
The EPA allows a maximum of 5 picocuries of radium per liter of drinking water. Produced water has been found to contain radium levels as high as 9,000 picocuries per liter (pCi/g)..”

``You may be wondering how a company like Eureka could get away with repackaging byproducts from fracking and selling them without informing the public about what they really are. But the process is perfectly legal in Pennsylvania through a regulatory mechanism called “de-wasting.” De-wasting essentially means rebranding waste as a new product, often without significant treatment to remove health and environmental hazards.”

``The Pittsburgh University Center for Healthy Environments and Communities (CHEC) has been examining how organic compounds in the shale can be mobilized during fracturing and gas extraction processes. According to the CHEC researchers, these organic compounds are brought to the surface in the fracturing flowback or produced water, and often go into open impoundments (frac ponds), where the wastewater, “will off-gas its organic compounds into the air. This becomes an air pollution problem, and the organic compounds are now termed Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP’s).”.''

``After learning about an unlined pit site, Clean Water Action began to investigate one pair of pits located near McKittrick in Kern County. By reviewing public documents, and using citizens collected air quality samples, the investigation found documentation of a plume of wastewater containing heavy metals such as boron, high salinity, and other constituents of concern, that has migrated towards high quality, useable groundwater resources. The Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (CVRWQCB or Central Valley Board) has required groundwater testing near the site since 2004. The test results — all public documents — indicate that a plume of wastewater, matching the characteristics of the wastewater in the pits, extends close to a mile to the northeast of the pits. It extends towards the Kern River Flood Channel, the California Aqueduct and high-quality groundwater used for significant agricultural activity.

``The California study focused on a series of pits in Kern County, around Bakersfield. The report suggests that hundreds of pits throughout the state and especially those in the heavily drilled Central Valley pose environmental and health threats."We think this is potentially the biggest impact of oil and gas development in California," said Andrew Grinberg, oil and gas program manager for Clean Water Action, in issuing the report. California is the fourth-largest oil-producing state in the U.S., according to the report.  In 2013, the industry produced 8 billion gallons of oil in California while generating 130 billion gallons of wastewater, or approximately 15 barrels of wastewater for every barrel of oil, according to the report.''

``In 2013, the industry produced 8 billion gallons of oil in California, and 130 billion gallons of wastewater, or approximately 15 barrels of wastewater for every barrel of oil that is produced. Oil and gas wastewater contains both naturally occurring and added contaminants, including carcinogens, heavy metals, radioactive materials, and salts. In California, oil and gas wastewater is disposed of in four different ways: underground injection into Class II disposal wells; reinjection for enhanced oil recovery (EOR); irrigation of crops; or disposal into unlined pits, also known as sumps. Each presents its own unique challenges and threats to water quality, health, and the environment, but unlined and open-air pits are especially troubling because they are designed to percolate and evaporate toxic chemicals into the environment.''

``The discharge of wastewater into unlined pits threatens water resources, including potential sources of drinking and irrigation water, and impacts air quality due to the off-gassing of chemicals from the wastewater. The majority of these pits are near waterways, increasing the likelihood that spills and surface-to-groundwater migration will impact water resources. There has been no comprehensive review of locations of pits in relation to high-quality groundwater.''

``Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is the process of injecting pressurized water, chemicals, and sand into the ground to extract shale oil and natural gas. While fracking has transformed energy production in the U.S., it requires a lot of water and thus creates a lot of wastewater, which must be treated and disposed of safely.

``Once they’ve paid off the victims, the fracking operation is protected and the families are bound to the company, thus, sweeping any evidence of fracking’s dangers under the rug. The practice has proved helpful for the fracking companies in that when giving testimony to Congress, there is no pushback from those who have witnessed and experienced fracking pollution first hand.     “These gag orders are the reason [drillers] can give testimony to Congress and say there are no documented cases of contamination,” said Earthworks organizer Sharon Wilson.  Companies and lawmakers friendly to the companies have even gone so far as to gag doctors from expressing their professional concerns about dangerous fracking chemicals. Last year, a law passed in Pennsylvania that allows doctors to access the listing of the chemicals used in fracking. However, the doctors are prohibited from telling their patients about it.”

``RCRA's major goals are to reduce waste and provide for the conservation of resources. RCRA's other goals include protecting human health and the environment from potential harm caused by improper waste disposal and (after being amended in 1984) from leaking underground storage tanks. RCRA's management requirements for solid waste and hazardous waste can create a significant administrative and compliance burden on a campus. In most cases, individual states implement and manage the federal RCRA program, as they do with many other federal environmental programs. State environmental protection agencies implement their RCRA programs after receiving approval from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Although these approved state programs operate in lieu of the federal program, EPA retains regulatory oversight over every state program. Although approved programs must provide at least equivalent protection as the federal RCRA standards, states have some flexibility with their own programs. Although no state program can be less restrictive than federal regulations, states may create more stringent requirements by law, rule, or interpretation. RCRA gave EPA and state agencies the authority to require management of hazardous wastes from "Cradle-to-Grave." It also set forth a framework for the management of nonhazardous solid wastes, created a comprehensive underground storage tank (UST) program, and required financial surety for cleanup of releases on operating facilities. In general, the RCRA program established the definitions of solid and hazardous wastes; the design and operational requirements for landfills, incinerators, USTs, etc.; the design, operation, and management requirements for hazardous waste handling and storage containers and structures; a permitting system for entities that create, manage, transport, treat, or dispose of hazardous wastes, including requirements for cleanup of any releases and financial bonding to ensure the availability of funds for possible future cleanups; a cradle-to-grave manifest system used to track hazardous waste; and the liability of the entity (such as a campus) that produces wastes.”

``The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) is our nation’s primary law governing the disposal of solid and hazardous waste. RCRA was signed into law on October 21, 1976, to address the increasing problems the nation faced from our growing volume of municipal and industrial waste. RCRA was an amendment to the Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965, which was the first statute that specifically focused on improving solid waste disposal methods.
Since 1976, RCRA has been amended and strengthened by Congress including in November 1984 with the passage of the federal Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments (HSWA). Among other mandates, these amendments to RCRA required phasing out land disposal of hazardous waste, corrective action for releases and waste minimization. Waste minimization refers to the use of source reduction and/or environmentally sound recycling methods prior to treating or disposing of hazardous wastes.”

``Radford Army Ammunition Plant (Radford AAP) is a government-owned/contractor-operated (GO/CO) industrial complex located in Radford, Virginia. Construction of the production facilities began in 1940 with the impending participation of the United States in World War II and the need for increased ammunition production facilities. Since the need for ammunition production has decreased, the Army is trying to diversify the operating capabilities of the facility. Radford AAP is an RCRA permitted facility which is subject to Corrective Action and, due to the magnitude and extensive operating history, maintains areas potentially subject to cleanup via the Superfund program. While the clean-up of Federal Facilities is typically done under CERCLA authority, in this particular instance, there were concerns that an NPL listing would decrease the economic development potential for this GO/CO facility. Recognizing this problem, EPA Region III worked cooperatively with facility representatives and the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality and developed a unique RCRA Corrective Action Permit that addressed both RCRA and CERCLA concerns yet allowed economic development to continue at the site. In an effort to reduce duplication of effort and investigation costs, the Permit contains provisions which closely parallel those typically found in Federal Facilities Agreements negotiated in the CERCLA program. In addition, remediation of the site will be integrated under the direction of one Project Manager in the Region's Superfund program. The economic development of underutilized Army plants is paying off, under the Armaments Retooling and Manufacturing Support ( ARMS ) Initiative. At Radford, 19 commercial tenant activities have located or relocated/expanded there. These businesses include commercial powders, pyrotechnics, metalworking, wholesalers of pipe, valves \& fittings, hardware, tools and fasteners, a wellness center, and office activities. A total of 360 tenant jobs have been created, of which over 300 are manufacturing. This philosophy of diversification has brought new jobs to the surrounding community. The estimated economic impact of each new good manufacturing job is 1-3 indirect support jobs for the community Radford AAP is owned by the U.S. Department of the Army and is operated by Alliant Ammunition and Powder Company LLC under a facility use agreement and contains approximately 1969 buildings and occupies over 6900 acres. The facility is located in Pulaski and Montgomery counties approximately 10 miles west of Blacksburg and 47 southwest of Roanoke.

``Driving north along Highway 33  nicknamed the ``Petroleum Highway''  the group turned off to the east, down a narrow, unmarked and publicly accessible dirt road. A large tanker truck was visible in the distance. It appeared to be dumping water into the ground. Minutes later, the tour approached a gate with a sign reading ``Danger H2S May Be Present.'' Tour members stepped out of the vehicles and were immediately hit with a noxious odor. Several tied bandanas around their mouths and noses to block the fumes. In less than five minutes, many in the group complained of nausea and headaches. The site consisted of a few dozen long narrow ponds, some with standing liquids of different shades of green, brown and black, some dry and empty. The closest pond contained two thick pipes that were discharging steaming black and green fluids to the pond, while vapors visibly rose off the surface of the ponds. A thick black ring of what appeared to be oil rimmed the bank and a shimmering black layer floated on the surface. Pipes connected the first pond receiving the discharge to other, larger ponds stretching out hundreds of yards into the distance.''

\ul{``Frac ponds are another common reason why fracking companies have a bad reputation with environmentalists and the general population. Frac ponds are essentially open-air pools where wastewater is stored and allowed to evaporate into the air over time. This has obvious air contamination concerns, but these ponds are also dangerous for wildlife that confuse the dirty wastewater with fresh water to drink.} Our above-ground storage tanks are an excellent alternative to these frac ponds, and they are much more environmentally friendly.”

``\ul{Fracking enjoys loopholes from a number of our bedrock environmental laws,'' Raichel notes. For example, oil and gas waste is not considered a hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.} This can make it difficult for concerned citizens to push the needle on a federal level, but it’s still important to call your elected representatives and urge them to close these loopholes. ``Although sweeping change might be slow in coming, staying vocal keeps the pressure on elected officials and industry,” Raichel says. ``As we’ve seen before, if there is enough of a groundswell, it will make a difference.”

Her report Moving America Forward assessed the impact of state and national policies to reduce global warming emissions, and she has written numerous reports on the benefits of state adoption of stronger vehicle emission standards.

\paragraph{}
``Waste from oil and gas fracking is exempt from the hazardous waste provisions of the federal Resource Conservation Recovery Act (RCRA), exacerbating the toxic threats posed by fracking wastewater. For other industries, the threats posed by toxic waste have been at least reduced due to the adoption of the RCRA, which provides a national framework for regulating hazardous waste. In other industries, illegal dumping is reduced by cradle-to-grave tracking and criminal penalties. Health-threatening practices such as open waste pits, disposal in ordinary landfills, and road spreading are prohibited.”

\subsection{Wastewater Used For Irrigation}

``In the last three years, farmers in parts of California's Central Valley irrigated nearly 100,000 acres of food crops with billions of gallons of oil field wastewater possibly tainted with toxic chemicals, including chemicals that can cause cancer and reproductive harm, according to an Environmental Working Group (EWG) analysis of state data.”

``\textbf{Salt.} Flowback and produced water are highly salty. This is because salts are added to the fracturing fluid and also released from the geologic formation. Produced water is so famous for salinity that the hydrocarbon industry often refers to it simply as “saltwater” or “brine.” In the Marcellus Shale, flowback water has been measured at 32,300 mg per liter of sodium. For comparison, EPA guidelines call for a maximum of 20 mg/L in drinking water.
\subparagraph{}
\textbf{Industrial chemicals.} Flowback and produced water contain chemicals that have been injected into the well to facilitate drilling. For example, in the Marcellus Shale, flowback water contains high concentrations of sodium, magnesium, iron, barium, strontium, manganese, methanol, chloride, sulfate and other substances.
\subparagraph{}
\textbf{Hydrocarbons.} Produced water can contain hydrocarbons -- including the toxic substances benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene – which can be freed during the drilling process.
\subparagraph{}
\textbf{Radioactive materials.}Water returned to the surface during drilling can carry naturally occurring radioactive materials, referred to by the industry as “NORM.” Flowback and produced water from several large U.S. shale formations have been found to contain the radioactive element radium. When produced water is salty and rich in chlorides, radium tends to be present in higher concentrations.
The EPA allows a maximum of 5 picocuries of radium per liter of drinking water. Produced water has been found to contain radium levels as high as 9,000 picocuries per liter (pCi/g)..”
